## About the Project

This project was developed to provide a quick and accurate way to identify skin diseases using AI. It leverages a trained machine learning model to analyze images uploaded by users.

## Key Features

*   **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of skin conditions.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** The app uses a pre-trained AI model to classify the disease.
*   **Results Display:**  The predicted disease and its symptoms are displayed.
*   **High Accuracy:** Achieves 92% accuracy on a dataset of 1000+ labeled images.

## Technologies Used
  * Node.js
  * Reacts
