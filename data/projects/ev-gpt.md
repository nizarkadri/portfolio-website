## 🔬 Project Overview

EV-GPT is a sophisticated question-answering system that leverages Google's Generative AI to provide detailed insights about electric vehicles. By creating a vector database from PDF and TXT documents, it enables powerful semantic search and Q&A capabilities. The system features a modern Streamlit web interface that delivers context-aware responses about electric vehicles based on comprehensive documentation.

**🎯 Problem**: Limited access to comprehensive, up-to-date information about electric vehicles and difficulty in finding specific answers from technical documentation.
